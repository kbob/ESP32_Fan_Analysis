# ESP32 Fan Analysis

I want to create a responsive, accurate, fan tachometer.

## Files

* acquire/ - an ESP32 program that runs a PWM fan through several scenarios
and captures PWM and tach traces for later analysis

* traces/ - acquired traces

* analyze/ - Python and Jupyter analysis of the traces
